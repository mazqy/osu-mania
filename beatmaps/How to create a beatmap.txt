HOW TO CREATE A BEATMAP

1. Folder Creation:
   - Start by creating a folder with the title of your beatmap.

2. Notes Text File:
   - Inside this folder, create a text file named "notes.txt".
   - Ensure that the file begins with "0 0".
   - For each note, indicate the time (in seconds) and the corresponding key (1, 2, 3, or 4), separated by a space.
   - List each note on a new line.

3. Audio File:
   - Include the song in the beatmap folder in .mp3 format.
   - The audio file must share the same name as the beatmap title.
